My research problem is about countries bailout packages during mainly shutdowns. Due to Covid-19 virus, a lot of countries decided to
go lockdowns. That means, those countries was supposed to be in quarantine for many days. 

In those quarantine days, especially private sector employees, and craftpersons were affected because businesses couldn't run.
Because of this reason, the countries that decided to go shutdown announced bailout packages.

Some of the countries bailout package amounts are enough to stay in quarantine by not working. On the other hand, the other countries bailout 
package amounts are not enough to stay in quarantine by not working. This causes some serious economic depression in houses.
