Covid-19 is a worlwide pandemic. Because of this pandemic a lot people died, and a lot of people got infected. Since this virus can rapidly spread,
everbody tries to protect himself, and also everybody tries to strengthen  his immune system to be able to fight against virus. These are mainly about pandemic's 
health effcets. On the other hand, there is a big economic effect of this pandemic over the people.

Because of Covid-19 pandemic, almost every economic activity either stopped, or slowed down. This means, in different economic areas commerce volume decreased.
Unfortunately a lot of employees got fired. That means, fired people needed to get some financial help during pandemic. 

After Covid-19 spreaded quickly, countries understood that this is a serious pandemic which is affect whole world. Therefore, a lot countries decided to go shutdown.
Shutdown or lockdown means every population must be in quarantine in their houses. They thought that we can get rid of this pandemic in this way. Even though
shutdown is a good solution to prevent fast spread of the virus, it occured some economic needs.

My research problem is about countries bailout packages during mainly shutdowns. Due to Covid-19 virus, a lot of countries decided to 
go lockdowns. That means, those countries was supposed to be in quarantine for many days. 

In those quarantine days, especially private sector employees, and craftpersons were affected because businesses couldn't run.
Because of this reason, the countries that decided to go shutdown announced bailout packages.

Some of the countries bailout package amounts are enough to stay in quarantine by not working. On the other hand, the other countries bailout 
package amounts are not enough to stay in quarantine by not working. This causes some serious economic depression in houses.
