# Bailout Money Amount Problems in Covid-19 (Deliverables "A")

Covid-19 is a worlwide pandemic. Because of this pandemic a lot people died, and a lot of people got infected. Since this virus can rapidly spread,
everbody tries to protect himself, and also everybody tries to strengthen  his immune system to be able to fight against virus. These are mainly about pandemic's 
health effects. On the other hand, there is a big economic effect of this pandemic over the people.

Because of Covid-19 pandemic, almost every economic activity either stopped, or slowed down. This means, in different economic areas commerce volume decreased.
Unfortunately a lot of employees got fired. That means, fired people needed to get some financial help during pandemic. 

After Covid-19 spreaded quickly, countries understood that this is a serious pandemic which affects whole world. Therefore, a lot countries decided to go shutdown.
Shutdown or lockdown means every population must be in quarantine in their houses. They thought that we can get rid of this pandemic in this way. Even though
shutdown is a good solution to prevent fast spread of the virus, it occured some economic needs.

My research problem is about countries bailout packages during mainly shutdowns. Due to Covid-19 virus, a lot of countries decided to 
go lockdowns. That means, those countries was supposed to be in quarantine for many days. 

In those quarantine days, especially private sector employees, and craftpersons were affected because businesses couldn't run.
Because of this reason, the countries that decided to go shutdown announced bailout packages.

Some of the countries bailout package amounts are enough to stay in quarantine by not working. On the other hand, the other countries bailout 
package amounts are not enough to stay in quarantine by not working. This causes some serious economic depression in houses.

# Explanations For Deliverables "B"

I got these data from various well-known news sites which announced the bailout money amounts per different countries. A lot countries announced their
bailout money amount as numerical, or as GDP rate.In the light of this information news sites, newspapers made news about it. I have checked that kind 
of sources, and after that I acquired some data about this topic. 

I faced some problems which are about uncertainty because although some countries announced their bailout amount obviously, some of them are didn't.
Some countries hide their political issues from the rest of the world. So, to reach some countries bailout money amount data was really tough.

I can say, I collected approximately 30-40 data. My research mainly contains countries. Since my data are about bailout amounts, 
I acquired 30-40 countries bailout money amount information.
